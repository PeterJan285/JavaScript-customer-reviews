## Welcome! 👋

- This exercise features customer reviews section using JS. First I put my objects (each person's information) into an array and select all my reference points. Then I set my starting review which I want to show, after clicking the buttons the review will change. Using conditional statements the reviews can go in circles back and forth.

### Languages and features 👨‍💻
